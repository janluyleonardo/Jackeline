## About System plus

systemplus is a web application with an expressive and elegant syntax. We created this platform for the entry and securing of information for students wishing to register with systemplus.
All this in order that the users (teachers) can enter in an optimal and safe way and that it is kept in a centralized place, where it can be accessed more quickly.
